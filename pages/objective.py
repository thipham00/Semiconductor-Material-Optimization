        Semiconductor materials are at the heart of modern electronics, powering everything from smartphones to solar panels. 
        However, identifying and refining new materials is a slow, resource-intensive process. Traditional methods like 
        density functional theory (DFT) offer precision but demand substantial computational power.

        This project seeks to revolutionize semiconductor material discovery by integrating advanced machine learning (ML) 
        and deep learning models. By leveraging tools like the ORCA quantum chemistry package to generate data on band gaps, 
        electron density, and molecular volume, we build predictive models that can evaluate material viability in seconds ‚Äî

        Our goal is simple: reduce waste, improve efficiency, and accelerate innovation. Using ensemble methods and graph 
        neural networks (GNNs), we aim to predict semiconductor performance with high accuracy. This enables rapid screening 
        of new materials, helping manufacturers minimize trial-and-error and make smarter, faster decisions.
